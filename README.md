# Lambda Calculus in OCaml

This repo is the OCaml version of [my previously journey with Haskell](https://github.com/miguel-nascimento/lambda-calculus/) to understand more about programming languages in general and be a better OCamaller.

## Goals

- [x] [Untyped Lambda Calculus](/untyped)
- [ ] Simply Typed Lambda Calculus λ→
- [ ] System F
- [ ] LambdaPi (Dependent Types)
